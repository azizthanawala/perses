# Welcome to Perses

This Storybook is currently a work-in-progress! Stay tuned for more information soon.

## Packages

The Perses project includes several packages that provide the building blocks that power the Perses app. These building
blocks can also be used to build other applications.

- <LinkTo kind="Components/About">@perses-dev/components</LinkTo> - Common components available to the app, plugins, or users
  who want to embed common Perses UI elements into their own applications.
- <LinkTo kind="Core/About">@perses-dev/core</LinkTo> - Core functionality that's exposed to plugins and also consumed by
  the app.
- <LinkTo kind="Dashboards/About">@perses-dev/dashboards</LinkTo> - Components for dashboards.
- <LinkTo kind="Panels Plugin/About">@perses-dev/panels-plugin</LinkTo> - A plugin module with `Panel` plugins for the core
  visualizations supported by Perses.
- <LinkTo kind="Plugin System/About">@perses-dev/plugin-system</LinkTo> - All the type definitions and components that power
  our plugins, also includes the definitions for the runtime available to plugins (e.g. the current time range state, the
  current template variable state).
- <LinkTo kind="Prometheus Plugin/About">@perses-dev/prometheus-plugin</LinkTo> - A plugin module with multiple plugin types
  (e.g. Variable, ChartQuery, etc.) for supporting Prometheus in Perses.
